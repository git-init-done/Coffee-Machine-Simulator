# ☕ Object-Oriented Coffee Machine Simulator in Python

Welcome to your virtual **Coffee Machine**, crafted with Python and built using the power of Object-Oriented Programming! This simulation allows users to order drinks like a real-world barista experience, managing resources and processing payments in the background.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 👤 **User Interaction** – Each customer has a name, preferred drink, and payment
- 🧠 **OOP Design** – Built using clean class hierarchies (`User` and `CoffeeMachine`)
- 🍵 **Drink Options** – Choose between:
  - Espresso ☕
  - Latte 🥛
  - Cappuccino 🍂
- 💰 **Bill Handling** – Calculates and checks payments
- 📉 **Ingredient Management** – Keeps track of coffee, milk, and sugar levels
- ⚠️ **Out-of-Stock Warnings** – Informs users when ingredients run low

---

## 🧩 Class Structure

- `User`  
  - Stores user name, selected drink, and payment amount

- `CoffeeMachine (inherits from User)`  
  - Manages inventory
  - Handles drink preparation logic
  - Calculates prices and handles transactions

---

## ▶️ How to Run

### 💻 Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed

### 🚦 Run the Program

```bash
python Coffee_Machine_OOP.py
```

---

Follow the terminal prompts to input your name, choose a drink, and make payment.

## 🔧 Potential Upgrades

- 🎨 GUI interface using `tkinter` or `PyQt`
- 🛒 Multiple user support and order queue
- 🧮 Real-time inventory refill system
- 📊 Reporting system for sales and resources
